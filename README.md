# TIA Portal V19 Autotest Generator
The TIA Portal V19 Autotest Generator is a Python script that automates the creation of test cases for Siemens' TIA Portal V19. It is particularly useful for engineers and developers who need to generate large sets of test cases for PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) programs or other automation systems.

The script takes input configurations (e.g., test scenarios, variables, and actions) and generates structured test cases in a format compatible with TIA Portal V19(.TAT). This saves time and reduces the risk of human error when creating test cases manually.

## Features
- Automated Test Case Generation: Generates test cases based on predefined logic and configurations.
- Flexible Input: Allows customization of test scenarios, actions, and variables.
- Compatible with TIA Portal V19: Outputs test cases in a format(.TAT) that can be imported into Siemens' TIA Portal V19.
- Example Provided: Includes an example of valve control logic test cases to demonstrate how the script works.
